## Hey there.

This is a small project I made to be a mock-up of a website I might make if I ever
sold any clothes that I make in my spare time.

It's quite simple as you can see but I have plans to create a database using PostgreSQL
and connect the data using a server.

In any case, check it out to see the progress I've made and I'll update it in the future.
